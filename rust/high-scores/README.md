# High Scores

Welcome to High Scores on Exercism's Rust Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Manage a game player's High Score list.

Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era. Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.

Consider retaining a reference to `scores` in the struct - copying is not
necessary. You will require some lifetime annotations, though.
