# Gigasecond

Welcome to Gigasecond on Exercism's Rust Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Given a moment, determine the moment that would be after a gigasecond
has passed.

A gigasecond is 10^9 (1,000,000,000) seconds.

If you're unsure what operations you can perform on `PrimitiveDateTime` take a look at the [time crate](https://docs.rs/time) which is listed as a dependency in the `Cargo.toml` file for this exercise.
