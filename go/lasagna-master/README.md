# Lasagna Master

Welcome to Lasagna Master on Exercism's Go Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.
If you get stuck on the exercise, check out `HINTS.md`, but try and solve it without using those first :)

## Introduction

A function allows you to group code into a reusable unit.
It consists of the `func` keyword, the name of the function, and a comma-separated list of zero or more parameters and types in round brackets.
All parameters must be explicitly typed; there is no type inference for parameters.
There are no default values for parameters so all function parameters are required.

```go
import "fmt"

// No parameters
func PrintHello() {
    fmt.Println("Hello")
}

// Two parameters
func PrintGreetingName(greeting string, name string) {
  fmt.Println(greeting + " " + name)
}
```

Parameters of the same type can be declared together, followed by a single type declaration.

```go
import "fmt"

func PrintGreetingName(greeting, name string) {
  fmt.Println(greeting + " " + name)
}
```

## Return Values

The function arguments are followed by zero or more return values which must also be explicitly typed.
Single return values are left bare, multiple return values are wrapped in parenthesis.
Values are returned to the calling code from functions using the `return` keyword.
There can be multiple `return` statements in a function.
The execution of the function ends as soon as it hits one of those `return`s.
If multiple values are to be returned from a function, they are comma separated.

```go
func Hello(name string) string {
  return "Hello " + name
}

func HelloAndGoodbye(name string) (string, string) {
  return "Hello " + name, "Goodbye " + name
}
```

## Invoking Functions

Invoking a function is done by specifying the function name and passing arguments for each of the function's parameters in parenthesis.

```go
import "fmt"

// No parameters, no return value
func PrintHello() {
    fmt.Println("Hello")
}
// Called like this:
PrintHello()

// One parameter, one return value
func Hello(name string) string {
  return "Hello " + name
}
// Called like this:
greeting := Hello("Dave")

// Multiple parameters, multiple return values
func SumAndMultiply(a, b int) (int, int) {
    return a+b, a*b
}
// Called like this:
aplusb, atimesb := SumAndMultiply(a, b)
```

## Named Return Values and Naked Return

As well as parameters, return values can optionally be named.
If named return values are used, a `return` statement without arguments will return those values.
This is known as a 'naked' return.

```go
func SumAndMultiplyThenMinus(a, b, c int) (sum, mult int) {
    sum, mult = a+b, a*b
    sum -= c
    mult -= c
    return
}
```

## Pointers

Functions in go pass their arguments by value.
This means that the arguments are copied, and any changes to those arguments within the function will not be seen outside the function.

```go
val := 2
func MultiplyByTwo(v int) int {
    v = v * 2
    return v
}
newval := MultiplyByTwo(val)
// newval is 4, val is 2
```

To affect the values a function is called with, it is possible to pass pointer arguments, using the `*` syntax in the function, and the `&` syntax to generate a pointer.

```go
func swap(x, y *int) {
    var temp int
    temp = *x
    *x = *y
    *y = temp
}

var a int = 100
var b int = 200
swap(&a, &b)
// a = 200, b = 100
```

## Instructions

In this exercise you are going to write some more code related to preparing and cooking your brilliant lasagna from your favorite cookbook.

You have four tasks.
The first one is related to the cooking itself, the other three are about the perfect preparation.

## 1. Estimate the preparation time

For the next lasagna that you will prepare, you want to make sure you have enough time reserved so you can enjoy the cooking.
You already planned which layers your lasagna will have.
Now you want to estimate how long the preparation will take based on that.

Implement a function `PreparationTime` that accepts an array of layers as a `[]string` and the average preparation time per layer in minutes as an `int`.
The function should return the estimate for the total preparation time based on the number of layers as an `int`.
Go has no default values for functions.
If the average preparation time is passed as `0` (the default initial value for an `int`), then the default value of `2` should be used.

```go
layers := []string{"sauce", "noodles", "sauce", "meat", "mozzarella", "noodles"}
PreparationTime(layers, 3)
// => 18
PreparationTime(layers, 0)
// => 12
```

## 2. Compute the amounts of noodles and sauce needed

Besides reserving the time, you also want to make sure you have enough sauce and noodles to cook the lasagna of your dreams.
For each noodle layer in your lasagna, you will need 50 grams of noodles.
For each sauce layer in your lasagna, you will need 0.2 liters of sauce.

Define the function `Quantities` that takes an array of layers as parameter as a `[]string`.
The function will then determine the quantity of noodles and sauce needed to make your meal.
The result should be returned as two values of `noodles` as an `int` and `sauce` as a `float64`.

```go
Quantities([]string{"sauce", "noodles", "sauce", "meat", "mozzarella", "noodles"})
// => 100, 0.4
```

## 3. Add the secret ingredient

A while ago you visited a friend and ate lasagna there.
It was amazing and had something special to it.
The friend sent you the list of ingredients and told you the last item on the list is the "secret ingredient" that made the meal so special.
Now you want to add that secret ingredient to your recipe as well.

Write a function `AddSecretIngredient` that accepts two arrays of ingredients of type `[]string` as parameters.
The first parameter is the list your friend sent you, the second is the ingredient list for your own recipe.
The function should generate a new slice and add the last item from your friends list to the end of your list.
Neither argument should be modified.

```go
friendsList := []string{"noodles", "sauce", "mozzarella", "kampot pepper"}
myList := []string{"noodles", "meat", "sauce", "mozzarella"}

AddSecretIngredient(friendsList, myList)
// => []string{"noodles", "meat", "sauce", "mozzarella", "kampot pepper"}
```

## 4. Scale the recipe

The amounts listed in your cookbook only yield enough lasagna for two portions.
Since you want to cook for more people next time, you want to calculate the amounts for different numbers of portions.

Implement a function `ScaleRecipe` that takes two parameters.

- A slice of `float64` amounts needed for 2 portions.
- The number of portions you want to cook.

The function should return a slice of `float64` of the amounts needed for the desired number of portions.
You want to keep the original recipe though.
This means the `amounts` argument should not be modified in this function.

```go
quantities := []float64{ 1.2, 3.6, 10.5 }
scaledQuantities := ScaleRecipe(quantities, 4)
// => []float64{ 2.4, 7.2, 21 }
```
