# Nth Prime

Welcome to Nth Prime on Exercism's Go Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Given a number n, determine what the nth prime is.

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that
the 6th prime is 13.

If your language provides methods in the standard library to deal with prime
numbers, pretend they don't exist and implement them yourself.
