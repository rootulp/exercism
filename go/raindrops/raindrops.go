// Convert returns a string  generated based on the raindrops rules below.

// - has 3 as a factor, add 'Pling' to the result.
// - has 5 as a factor, add 'Plang' to the result.
// - has 7 as a factor, add 'Plong' to the result.
// - does not have any of 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number.
