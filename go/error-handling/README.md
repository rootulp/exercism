# Error Handling

Welcome to Error Handling on Exercism's Go Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Implement various kinds of error handling and resource management.

An important point of programming is how to handle errors and close
resources even if errors occur.

This exercise requires you to handle various errors. Because error handling
is rather programming language specific you'll have to refer to the tests
for your track to see what's exactly required.

Testing for specific error types may be performed by
[type assertions](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Type_assertions). You may also
need to look at
[named return values](https://blog.golang.org/defer-panic-and-recover) as a
helpful way to return error information from panic recovery.
