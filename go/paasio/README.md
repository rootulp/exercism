# PaaS I/O

Welcome to PaaS I/O on Exercism's Go Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Report network IO statistics.

You are writing a [PaaS][], and you need a way to bill customers based
on network and filesystem usage.

Create a wrapper for network connections and files that can report IO
statistics. The wrapper must report:

- The total number of bytes read/written.
- The total number of read/write operations.
