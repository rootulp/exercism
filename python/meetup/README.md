# Meetup

Calculate the date of meetups.

Typically meetups happen on the same day of the week.

Examples are

- the first Monday
- the third Tuesday
- the Wednesteenth
- the last Thursday

There are exactly 7 days that end in '-teenth'. Therefore, one is
guaranteed that each day of the week will have a '-teenth' in every
month.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `exercism/python/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.py` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/python/bob/bob.py`.
