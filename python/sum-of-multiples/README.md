# Sum Of Multiples

Write a program that, given a number, can find the sum of all the multiples of particular numbers up to but not including that number.

If we list all the natural numbers up to but not including 15 that are
multiples of either 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9, 10, and 12.

The sum of these multiples is 45.

Write a program that can find the sum of the multiples of a given set of
numbers.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `exercism/python/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.py` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/python/bob/bob.py`.


For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
please see the [help page](http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-python.html).
