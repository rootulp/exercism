# Pascals Triangle

Write a program that computes Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows.

In Pascal's Triangle each number is computed by adding the numbers to
the right and left of the current position in the previous row.

```plain
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
# ... etc
```

You will need the Minitest gem. To install it, open a
terminal window and run:
