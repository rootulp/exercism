# Palindrome Products

Write a program that can detect palindrome products in a given range.

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome
made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 x 99.

You will need the Minitest gem. To install it, open a
terminal window and run:

    gem install minitest
