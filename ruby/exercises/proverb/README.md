# Proverb

For want of a horseshoe nail, a kingdom was lost, or so the saying goes. Write a program that outputs the full text of this proverbial rhyme.

For want of a nail the shoe was lost.
For want of a shoe the horse was lost.
For want of a horse the rider was lost.
For want of a rider the message was lost.
For want of a message the battle was lost.
For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.
And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.
