# Largest Series Product

Write a program that, when given a string of digits, can calculate the largest product for a series of consecutive digits of length n.

For example, for the input `'0123456789'`, the largest product for a
series of 3 digits is 504 (7 * 8 * 9), and the largest product for a
series of 5 digits is 15120 (5 * 6 * 7 * 8 * 9).

For the input `'73167176531330624919225119674426574742355349194934'`,
the largest product for a series of 6 digits is 23520.

You will need the Minitest gem. To install it, open a
terminal window and run:

    gem install minitest
