## Running the tests

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ yarn test
```

## Skipped tests

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by changing `xit` to
`it`.

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit dnd-character.ts` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
