# Hexadecimal

Write a program that will convert a hexadecimal number, represented as a string (e.g. "10af8c"), to its decimal equivalent using first principles (i.e. no, you may not use built-in ruby libraries or gems to accomplish the conversion).

On the web we use hexadecimal to represent colors, e.g. green: 008000,
teal: 008080, navy: 000080).

The program should handle invalid hexadecimal strings.

Refer to the [Exercism help page](http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-coffeescript.html) for getting started with CoffeeScript.

In order to run the test, you can run the test file from the exercise directory. For example, if the test suite is called hello_world.spec.coffee, you can run the following command:
    jasmine-node --coffee hello_world.spec.coffee
